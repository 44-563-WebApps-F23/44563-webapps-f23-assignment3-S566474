        <h4>
            Tom Sawyer
        </h4>
        <p>
            Considered the epitome of the all-American boy, Tom Sawyer is full of mischief but basically pure-hearted.<br> He is probably best remembered for the incident in which <br>he gets a number of other boys to whitewash his Aunt Polly's fence—an unpleasant task in his eyes—by making the work seem to be extremely absorbing.<br>
